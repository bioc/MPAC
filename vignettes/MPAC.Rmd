# Introduction

From copy-number alteration (CNA), RNA-seq data, and pre-defined biological
pathway network, MPAC computes Inferred Pathway Levels (IPLs) for pathway 
entities, clusters patient samples by their enriched GO terms, and identifies
key pathway proteins for each patient cluster.

# Preparing input

## Requirements

`r focal_url=paste0('https://docs.gdc.cancer.gov/Data/',
    'Bioinformatics_Pipelines/CNV_Pipeline/#data-processing-steps_2')`

MPAC accepts two types of genomic data: 

- copy-number alteration (CNA): recommend using data from
    [focal-level](`r focal_url`).
- RNA-seq: both tumor and normal sample data are required. Recommend using 
    normalized gene expression data, e.g. FPKM.

## Real data

This section describes preparing PARADIGM input using data from real samples,
which can be downloaded from TCGA or taken from sequencing experiments.

### Copy-number alteration

```{r ppCnInp}
# a matrix of CN focal data with rows as genes and columns as samples
cn_tumor_mat = system.file('extdata/TcgaInp/focal_tumor.rds',
                            package='MPAC') %>% readRDS()

# to return a matrix of CN state for running PARADIGM
# activated, normal, or repressed state is represented by 1, 0, or -1
ppCnInp(cn_tumor_mat) %>% .[1:4, 1:3]
```

### RNA-seq

Note that data from normal samples are required here to evaluate if a gene
in tumor samples has activated, repressed, or normal states.

```{r ppRnaInp}
# a matrix of RNA-seq data with rows as genes and columns as tumor samples
rna_tumor_mat = system.file('extdata/TcgaInp/log10fpkmP1_tumor.rds',
                            package='MPAC') %>% readRDS()

# a matrix of RNA-seq data with rows as genes and columns as normal samples
rna_norm_mat  = system.file('extdata/TcgaInp/log10fpkmP1_normal.rds',
                            package='MPAC') %>% readRDS()

# to return a matrix of RNA state for running PARADIGM
# activated, normal, or repressed state is represented by 1, 0, or -1
ppRnaInp(rna_tumor_mat, rna_norm_mat, threads=2) %>% .[1:4, 1:3]
```


## Permuted data

Pathway activities from permuted data will be used to build a background 
distribution to filter those from real data. The idea is to remove those that
could be observed by chance. Permuted data were from real CN and RNA data as 
shown in the example below.

```{r ppPermInp}
# CN state from real samples. It should be the output from `ppCnInp()` above.
real_cn_mat  = system.file('extdata/TcgaInp/inp_focal.rds',
                            package='MPAC') %>% readRDS()

# RNA state from real samples. It should be the output from `ppRnaInp()` above.
real_rna_mat = system.file('extdata/TcgaInp/inp_log10fpkmP1.rds',
                            package='MPAC') %>% readRDS()

# to return a list of list
permll = ppPermInp(real_cn_mat, real_rna_mat, n_perms=3)

# three objects under the first level
length(permll)

# object names
names(permll[[1]])

# permutation index
permll[[1]]$iperm

# permuted CN  state matrix, same format as the one from `ppCnInp()`
permll[[1]] %$% CN  %>% .[1:4, 1:3]

# permuted RNA state matrix, same format as the one from `ppRnaInp()`
permll[[1]] %$% RNA %>% .[1:4, 1:3]
```


# Inferred pathway levels

## PARADIGM binary

```{r, echo=FALSE}
prd_paper_url='https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btq182'
prd_exe_url = paste0('https://github.com/sng87/paradigm-scripts/tree/',
    'master/public/exe/')
prd_linux_url= paste0(prd_exe_url, 'LINUX')
prd_macos_url= paste0(prd_exe_url, 'MACOSX')
```

MPAC uses PARADIGM developed by [Vaske et al.](`r prd_paper_url`) to predict
pathway levels. PARADIGM Binary is available to download at Github for 
[Linux](`r prd_linux_url`) and [MacOS](`r prd_macos_url`).

## IPLs from real data

Example below shows input and output files for running PARADIGM on data from
real samples.

PARADIGM will generate multiple output files. All the file names will start with
the sample ID and a suffix indicating their types:

- Inferred pathway levles (IPLs): file with a suffix `ipl.txt`
- Output log: file with a suffix `run.out`
- Error log: file with a suffix `run.err`
- Other auxiliary files, which can be skipped under common usage

```{r runRealPrd}
# CN state matrix from `ppCnInp()`
cn_state_mat  = system.file('extdata/TcgaInp/inp_focal.rds',       
                            package='MPAC') %>% readRDS()

# RNA state matrix from `ppRnaInp()`
rna_state_mat = system.file('extdata/TcgaInp/inp_log10fpkmP1.rds', 
                            package='MPAC') %>% readRDS()

# Pathway file
fpth = system.file('extdata/Pth/tiny_pth.txt', package='MPAC')

# folder to save all the output files
outdir = tempdir()

# PARADIGM binary location. Replace the one below with a true location.
paradigm_bin = '/path/to/PARADIGM'

### code below depends on external PARADIGM binary, not to run in this vignette.
#
#   runPrd(cn_state_mat, rna_state_mat, fpth, outdir, paradigm_bin, 
#          sampleids=c('TCGA-CF-7100'))
#
```

## PARADIGM on permuted data

For permuted input, PARADIGM will generate output in the same fashion as on
real data above, except that one permutation corresponds to one output folder
named as `p$(index)`, where `$index` is the index of that permutation. For 
example, three permutations will generate folders `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`.

```{r runPermPrd}
# a list of list from `ppPermInp()`
permll =system.file('extdata/TcgaInp/inp_perm.rds', package='MPAC') %>%
        readRDS()

# Pathway file
fpth = system.file('extdata/Pth/tiny_pth.txt',     package='MPAC')

# folder to save all the output files
outdir = tempdir()

# PARADIGM binary location. Replace the one below with a true location.
paradigm_bin = '/path/to/PARADIGM'

# (optional) sample IDs to run PARADIGM on
pat = 'TCGA-CV-7100'

### code below depends on external PARADIGM binary, not to run in this vignette.
#
#   runPermPrd(permll, fpth, outdir, paradigm_bin, sampleids=c(pat))
#
```


# Collecting IPLs

MPAC has PARADIGM run on individual sample in parallel to speed up calculation.
For the convenience of downstream analysis, PARADIGM results will be collected
and put together for all samples. 

## From PARADIGM on real data

```{r colRealIPL}
# the folder saving PARADIGM result on real data
# it should be the `outdir` folder from `runPrd()`
indir = system.file('/extdata/runPrd/', package='MPAC')

# to return a data.table with columns as entities and IPLs for each sample
colRealIPL(indir) %>% head()
```

## From PARADIGM on permuted data

```{r colPermIPL}
# the folder saving PARADIGM result on permuted data
# it should be the `outdir` folder from `runPermPrd()`
indir = system.file('/extdata/runPrd/', package='MPAC')

# number of permutated dataset results to collect
n_perms = 3

# return a data.table with columns as entities, permutation index, and IPLs for
# each sample
colPermIPL(indir, n_perms) %>% head()
```


# Filtering IPLs

MPAC uses PARADIGM runs on permuted data to generate a background distribution
of IPLs. This distribution is used to filter IPLs from real data to remove
those could be observed by chance. 

```{r fltByPerm}
# collected real IPLs. It is the output from `colRealIPL()`
realdt = system.file('extdata/fltByPerm/real.rds', package='MPAC') %>% readRDS()

# collected permutation IPLs. It is the output from `colPermIPL()`
permdt = system.file('extdata/fltByPerm/perm.rds', package='MPAC') %>% readRDS()

# to return a matrix of filtered IPLs with rows as pathway entities and columns
# as samples. Entities with IPLs observed by chance are set to NA.
fltByPerm(realdt, permdt) %>% head()
```

# Find the largest pathway subset

MPAC decomposes the original pathway and identify the largest pathway subset 
with all of its entities having filtered IPLs. This sub-pathway allows the user
to focus on the most altered pathway network. Note that, because the set of 
entities having filtered IPLs are often different between samples, the 
pathway subset will be different between samples as well and represent 
sample-specific features.

```{r subNtw}
# a matrix generated by `fltByPerm()`
fltmat = system.file('extdata/fltByPerm/flt_real.rds', package='MPAC') %>%
        readRDS()

# a pathway file
fpth = system.file('extdata/Pth/tiny_pth.txt', package='MPAC')

# a gene set file in MSigDB's GMT format. It should be the same file that will
# be used in the over-representation analysis below.
fgmt = system.file('extdata/ovrGMT/fake.gmt', package='MPAC')

# to return a list of igraph objects representing the larget sub-pathway for
# each sample
subNtw(fltmat, fpth, fgmt, min_n_gmt_gns=1)
```

# Gene set over-representation

To understand the biological functions of a sample's largest sub-pathway, MPAC
performs gene set over-representation analysis on genes with non-zero IPLs in 
the sub-pathway. 

```{r ovrGMT}
# a list of igraph objects from `subNtw()`
subntwl = system.file('extdata/subNtw/subntwl.rds', package='MPAC') %>%readRDS()

# a gene set file that has been used in `subNtw()`
fgmt = system.file('extdata/ovrGMT/fake.gmt',       package='MPAC')

# (optional) genes that have CN and RNA data in the input files for PARADIGM
omic_gns =  system.file('extdata/TcgaInp/inp_focal.rds', package='MPAC') %>%
            readRDS() %>% rownames()

# to return a matrix of over-representation adjusted p-values with rows as gene
# set and columns as samples
ovrGMT(subntwl, fgmt, omic_gns)
```

# Cluster samples by pathway over-representation

With gene set over-representation adjusted p-values, MPAC can cluster samples
as a way to investigate shared features between samples in the same cluster.

```{r clSamp}
# a matrix of gene set over-representation adjusted p-values from `ovrGMT()`
ovrmat = system.file('extdata/clSamp/ovrmat.rds', package='MPAC') %>% readRDS()

# to return a matrix of clustering results with rows as samples and a column
# of cluster index
clSamp(ovrmat) %>% head()
```

# Find consensus pathway motifs within a cluster

From the clustering results, MPAC can find consensus pathway motifs from samples
within the same clusters. These motifs will represent cluster-specific pathway
features. They often contain key proteins for further analysis.

```{r conMtf}
# a list of igraph objects from `subNtw()`
subntwl = system.file('extdata/conMtf/subntwl.rds', package='MPAC') %>%readRDS()

# (optional) genes that have CN and RNA data in the input files for PARADIGM
omic_gns = system.file('extdata/TcgaInp/inp_focal.rds', package='MPAC') %>%
            readRDS() %>% rownames()

# to return a list of igraph objects representing consensus motifs
conMtf(subntwl, omic_gns, min_mtf_n_nodes=50)
```

# Session Info

Below is the output of `sessionInfo()` on the system on which this document
was compiled.
