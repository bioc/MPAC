Description: Multi-omic Pathway Analysis of Cancer (MPAC), integrates 
    multi-omic data for understanding cancer mechanisms. It  
    predicts novel patient groups with distinct pathway profiles 
    as well as identifying key pathway proteins with potential clinical 
    associations. From CNA and RNA-seq data, it determines genesâ€™ DNA and RNA
    states (i.e., repressed, normal, or activated), which serve as the input 
    for PARADIGM to calculate Inferred Pathway Levels (IPLs). It also permutes
    DNA and RNA states to create a background distribution to filter IPLs as a 
    way to remove events observed by chance. It provides multiple methods for
    downstream analysis and visualization.
